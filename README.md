# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) for managing objects in an AirBnB clone. 
The command interpreter allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete various objects such as Users, States, Cities, and Places. 
This is the first step towards building a full web application that mimics the functionality of AirBnB.

## Command Interpreter
